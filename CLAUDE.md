# Project instructions

## Typography — eyebrow system

Two distinct eyebrow roles. Never style them the same.

**Title eyebrow** — the label directly above a slide title (`.k`)
- Everyday Sans Mono, **8px**, uppercase, letter-spacing `.26em`
- Color: True Blue (`var(--wm-true-blue, #0053e2)`); white on navy/dark slides
- One per slide, sitting above the title

**Module / content header** — labels inside content blocks, e.g. Pressure, Problem, Choice, Outcome (`.cap`)
- Everyday Sans **UI Medium (500)**, **12px**, sentence case, letter-spacing `.01em`
- Color: True Blue `#0053e2`; Sky Blue `#a9ddf7` on navy/dark slides
- Not mono, not uppercase — that distinction still belongs to the title eyebrow. Both
  eyebrow and content header are now True Blue; the difference is mono/uppercase/8px
  vs sentence-case/12px, not color.

These are the defaults for new slides and any new deck in this project.

## Color — reduce navy density

Navy (`#001e60`) is reserved for: dark slide backgrounds, primary body/heading text
color (inherited via the slide's base color), and standalone navy-fill callouts (see
the foundation/implication pattern below). It is **not** the default for plain
structural dividers — those should be light gray (`#c3c6cd` for a visible rule,
`#dee1e6`/`#eef0f3` for a hairline) so navy stays meaningful instead of blanket-heavy.
When a set of sibling boxes/cards shares a `border-top`, every sibling must use the
*same* color and width unless one is deliberately singled out — never split a
uniform row of boxes across two colors or weights without a reason.

Two distinct "called out" patterns exist. Never mix them within the same row of
siblings — a row either uses the light emphasis-card treatment on one sibling, or
none of them do.

**Emphasis-card pattern** (the one box *among peers* that gets called out, e.g. one
option in a decision matrix, one priority in a portfolio): light treatment —
accent-blue border (`#4dbdf5`, 1–2px matching its siblings' width),
`background:#f5f6f8`, `border-radius:12px`. No margin-top offset — its border must
align exactly with its siblings' top edge. Reserve this for the box that's *better*
or *recommended*, not the one that's foundational — and **not** for the last step of a
sequence. Filling the final card in a before/after or lifecycle row says "this one is
the pick" when the row is actually saying "this is where it ends up"; leave all the
siblings identical.

**Foundation/implication callout pattern** (a standalone declarative statement —
"here's what this depends on," "here's the implication," a load-bearing foundation
in a dependency stack): heavy treatment — solid navy fill (`background:#001e60`),
white body text, sky-blue (`#a9ddf7`) `.cap` label, `border-radius:12px`. This is not
a sibling-row pattern; it stands alone (e.g. the "Implication" bar on "Where the next
dollar goes," the "Advertiser Experience" owner box on "Operating model," Priority 03
on "Four priorities"). Use the heavier navy-fill weight specifically when the content
is foundational/load-bearing rather than merely preferred — weight should track
"what everything else depends on," not just "what's most desirable."

## CSS specificity note

Slide class rules are scoped as `.s .k`, `.s .cap`, etc. because the deck carries a
`.s h1,.s h2,.s p,.s span,.s div{color:inherit}` reset (needed to beat the design system's
explicit heading colors on dark slides). Unscoped `.k` / `.cap` rules lose to that reset
and silently render navy — always keep the `.s ` prefix.

## Layout

- Slide titles (`.t`) and lead paragraphs (`.d`) carry **no max-width** — they span the full
  content measure so they align with the right edge of the content grid below them.
- Slides are full-bleed and square. Never put a `border-radius` on a `<section class="s">`.
- Cards, panels and callouts: 12px radius. Chips, cells, lane blocks, image frames: 8px.
  Chart bars: 4px. Progress/confidence bars: pill.
- Highlighted rows inside hairline-ruled tables and matrix cells stay square.

## Slide titles — core vs appendix

**Core slides (01–34)** use Title Case takeaway titles, matching the revision brief:
"Advertisers Need Better Planning, Control & Confidence in Results", not "Advertiser
Feedback". Every core title should advance the argument on its own — someone reading
only the titles should get the strategy.

**Appendix slides (36–68)** keep sentence-case assertion titles, because they are full
sentences rather than phrases ("Advertisers should not have to translate Walmart to use
Walmart"). Don't Title Case a full sentence. The two tiers are deliberate; keep new
slides consistent with the tier they land in.

Either tier, the title addresses the **audience, not the author**. "Add a future
expansion horizon" and "Add ecosystem readiness as a guardrail" are edit notes that
survived into a leadership deck; they read as unfinished. State the thing instead: "A
fourth horizon extends the platform beyond Walmart US."

## Evidence strip — the priority-slide component

Each of the four strategic-priority slides (17–20) ends with the same compact block, and
it must stay identical across all four so the priorities read as one system:

```
border-top:1px solid #dee1e6 → grid 158px / 1fr → `.cap` "Evidence behind this priority"
→ 5 items, each `border-left:1px solid #dee1e6; padding:0 16px`, 13px/1.4 weight 300
```

Every item is a signal traceable to the evidence act (slides 05–12). Uniform border-left
on *all five* items, including the first — that is the segmented-row treatment, not a
singled-out sibling.

The five items are **parallel noun-led phrases**, each standing on its own. A strip once
shipped as a run-on sentence cut across five columns ("Advertisers ask for… / And for… /
But report… / And limited… / And insufficient…") — clauses, not peers. If an item opens
with "And" or "But", it belongs to the item before it and the strip is broken.

## Peer rows carry equal weight

Any row of sibling cards — before/after, lifecycle stages, option sets — must come out the
same height, and so must two rows being compared against each other. One card whose
subtitle wraps to a second line silently makes its whole row taller, and a before/after
comparison then reads as unequal weight rather than equal-weight change. Reserve the space
instead of hoping the copy fits: put a `min-height` on the wrapping element (a 12.5px/1.4
subtitle is 35px at two lines) so every card is sized for the longest one. The same goes
for chip rows — a row where two of seven chips wrap is a row with two heights.

## The grid

Fixed 1280×720 artboards — not responsive, so there are no breakpoints. What makes the
deck feel like one system is the constants, not a column count.

| | |
|---|---|
| Canvas | 1280 × 720, full-bleed, never a `border-radius` on `<section class="s">` |
| Margins | 72px left and right, 56px top |
| Bottom reserve | 96px, holding `.pg` / `.tk`; content may flow into it, but never over the marker |
| Content measure | **1136px** — every slide's widest element ends flush at 72px from the right |
| Gutters | 24px default, 32px for wide-set columns; all on the 4px scale |

**Column counts are content-driven** (2 through 8) and that is fine — a lifecycle wants
seven, a comparison wants three. A formal 12-column grid was considered and rejected:
the spans the content actually needs do not divide cleanly into 12, so it would either
constrain the content or produce fractional spans, for no gain at slide scale. The
alignment that matters is the outer measure and the rails, and those are fixed.

**Fixed track widths come from one set.** All multiples of 4:

`28 · 40 · 56 · 88 · 132 · 160 · 172 · 176 · 192 · 196 · 208 · 232 · 248 · 300`

There were once 19 distinct values, including **five different right-rail widths used
once each** (288/290/300/316/330), so the rail edge jumped by up to 42px as you paged.
The right content rail is now **always 300px** — its left edge lands at x=908 on every
slide that uses it (08, 09, 10, 11, 17). Do not introduce a new fixed width; reach for
one of the set above.

**Changing a rail re-flows its neighbour.** Narrowing a rail widens the content column
and can re-wrap it, so re-run the verification suite after any track change — that is
how the 30px narrowing on slide 11 was confirmed safe.

## Spacing sits on the 4px scale

Every `gap` comes from the design system's `--space-*` steps: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32,
40, 48, 64, 80, 96. The deck once ran at 35% compliance, and the off-scale values were
not an alternative system — they were near-misses two pixels off a real step (26, 34, 28,
18, 14, 10). Individually invisible; collectively the difference between tight and almost
tight. `gap` is now 100% on-scale; keep it there.

`padding` and `margin` are **not** blanket-snapped, because some off-scale values are
load-bearing: a 17px `padding-top` compensating a 2px border, and the 9–12px row paddings
that clear the takeaway footer on slides 21, 26, 29 and 30. Check what a value is doing
before you round it.

## Hairlines on navy: two weights only

White rules inside navy blocks are `rgba(255,255,255,.30)` for a rule and `.18` for a
hairline. Five opacities were in use at one point (.14/.16/.22/.26/.34), including two
inside a single eight-item grid. Two weights, no more.

## Stacked architecture bands share one container language

Where a slide stacks layers of one system (access → workspaces → foundations), give every
band the same shape — same radius, same padding — and let **fill weight** carry the rank:
`#f5f6f8` → `#eaf6fd` → navy, heaviest at the base. Three bands once had three different
treatments (no container, a bordered box, a navy fill), which told the eye they were three
unrelated kinds of object on the one slide whose whole argument is that they are layers of
one system. Gaps between peer bands are equal.

A slide-level tag (e.g. "Target experience model") goes `position:absolute; top:56px;
right:72px` — never in a flex row with the `.k` eyebrow, which pushes the whole title
block down and breaks the 56/80 header position every other slide holds.

## Page numbers over dark callouts

`.pg` is gray (`--wm-gray-600`) on light ground. Where a slide's bottom element is a
full-width navy callout that the page number lands on, switch it to Sky Blue
(`var(--wm-sky-blue,#a9ddf7)`) inline — the same dark-ground color convention `.k` and
`.cap` already follow. Do not leave gray-on-navy.

## Charts

Four charts carry the evidence, and chart craft is held to the same standard as copy.

**Colour does one job.** The five-theme bar chart is one series of counts on *nominal*
categories, so every bar is one colour (True Blue `#0053e2`, validated as a single
series). It once ran a navy→sky value ramp, which double-encoded bar length as hue and
spent the only free channel on information the bars already showed. The Display funnel
is different: its stages are genuinely ordered, so a one-hue light→dark ordinal ramp is
correct there — that ramp passes all ordinal checks, leave it alone.

**Geometry must equal the data — measure it, don't trust the CSS.** Percentage widths on
a flex item resolve against the flex container, but a sibling set to `width:100%` gets
*shrunk* to the track. That mismatch once rendered four of five bars ~44% too long
relative to the first, flattening the very ranking the slide argues. Put bars in an
explicit shared track (`flex:1` wrapper, percentage on the inner bar) and verify by
measuring rendered pixels per unit — all bars must agree within ~1%.

**Plot on a true linear scale.** The market line's three middle points sagged 3–4px,
making growth read as more accelerating than the forecast. Recompute coordinates from
the data; don't hand-place them.

**Axis labels live in the same coordinate space as the marks.** Year ticks in an HTML row
below an `xMidYMid meet` SVG do not align with points inside it — they drift with the
aspect fit. Put ticks in the SVG at the mark's own x.

**Chrome is recessive.** Axis rules are hairline gray (`#c3c6cd`), never navy — navy is
ink, not chrome, and the navy-density rule above says the same. No dashed gridlines or
decorative rules; dashing is reserved for a genuine reference line (the NPS period mean).

**Known open item:** the market chart's area fill is not zero-baselined — the fill bottom
sits at roughly $59B, so the filled area overstates magnitude even though every point is
labelled. Fine for a line, arguable for an area. Decide deliberately before this goes to
leadership.

## Navigation chrome (`deck-nav.js`)

The deck is read unattended as often as it is presented, so the nav *is* part of the
reading experience. Three rules it now holds:

- **The menu's open state has one writer.** `_setMenu()` sets `data-open` and the
  trigger's `aria-expanded` together. The trigger previously advertised
  `aria-haspopup` but never said whether it was open, so assistive tech could not tell.
  Never set `data-open` directly — the two will drift.
- **The seek track shows it is interactive.** It is a 4px strip whose only affordance
  was `cursor:pointer`; it now has a hover state. Its click mapping is segment-based
  (68 equal segments), which is internally consistent — clicking at the fill's right
  edge landing on the next slide is correct segment behaviour, not an off-by-one.
- **Reduced motion applies to the chrome too.** The deck honours
  `prefers-reduced-motion` for slide entrances; its nav did not, so the bar still slid
  and the progress fill still animated. Transitions are now disabled under the query.

**This deck does not get decorative motion.** Entrance animation is deliberately
confined to the cover and the four act dividers (`.anim-1`–`.anim-4`); content slides
have none. A leadership strategy deck earns trust by being still and legible — no
signature-moment flourishes on the evidence slides.

**Testing limit:** `deck-stage` needs a runtime that does not boot in a sandbox without
network egress, so nav *behaviour* (prev/next, seek, slide sync) cannot be exercised
locally — only the shadow root's construction and any method not needing the stage.
Treat logic changes here as unverified until clicked through in Claude Design.

## Layout verification

Three failure modes that `scrollHeight` will **not** catch, because `.s` sets
`overflow:hidden`:

1. **Clipped content** — compare every leaf text element's rect against the section rect.
2. **Collision with `.pg` / `.tk`** — content overlapping the bottom marker band.
   Check filled boxes too, not just text: a navy callout can swallow the page number.
3. **Dead zones** — measure slack between the lowest *inked* element and the marker.
   Container rects lie here; a `flex:1` wrapper always reaches the content-box bottom.
4. **Peer baselines** — for any sibling group whose border-tops land on one line, compare
   each sibling's first child baseline. A mismatch has many causes (a heavier border, a
   larger font, a different padding) and checking border *width* alone misses most of
   them. Spread must be 0.

Bottom slack varies legitimately across slides — a calm slide with little content is not
a defect, and padding it out to match a dense one is. Chase the outliers, not uniformity.

Content flowing into the 96px bottom padding is normal and tolerated; overlapping the
marker itself is not.

## Evidence guardrails

Claims that must never re-enter the deck (see `PRODUCT.md` → Capabilities and
Constraints): the "60–70% delivery head start" figure, the 3% onsite/offsite buyer
overlap (sourced from another retailer), any "no new funding required" framing, and any
statement that agencies are **deliberately** underserved. Thin agency coverage is a real
read of the FY28 plan and worth surfacing — but presenting it as a settled trade-off
claims an alignment leadership has not made. Put it as the open question it is.

Two four-word vocabularies exist on purpose and must not be merged: the prioritization
rubric scores *new* initiatives (Accelerate / Reshape / Sequence / Defer); the core deck's
dispositions reconcile commitments *already made* (Continue / Reshape / Sequence /
Reassess). Say which one a slide means.
Buyer statistics without a restored original source stay out — the deck carries the
verified Koddi/Forrester findings instead.
